#Document Downloader

As a university student, I get most of the studying stuff through the Internet. Most professors give me a URL where I can download all the required files to work (mostly, PDF theory files). The problem is that usually in that pages there are lots of files, and manually download all of them

I did this simple script to massively download files from a webpage which has all the links in it.  

##How it works



##Requirements

This script runs on Python 2.7 (I'm working on a Python 3 version), so if you have Python installed in your computer, it should work! I've tested heavily on a Mac, but if you have a Linux/Windows machine, you shouldn't have any problem.

You need Beautiful Soup to run it. The other packages we are using are bundled by default with any Python instalation.
